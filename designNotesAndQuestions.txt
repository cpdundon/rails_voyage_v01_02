Hi Dalia,

Voyage tracker is designed to track voyages (trips) on a fleet of boats (vessles).  It has 3 main tables.  Voyages, Vessles, and a join table in the middle with crew records.  Vessles have many Voyages...  I plan to modify the Vessle side of the application for this exercise.

Page by page design:
.../vessels/# (Show Vessel) via JSON
.../vessels (Index) via JSON
Vessel has_many Voyages via JSON - tack the voyages on to the index entry for a vessel on the .../vessles (index) url.
Submit form ...vessles/new via ajax.  

General Questions:
I plan to close the loop so that if I am on .../vessels/# (show) and the user transitions to .../vessles (index) then there will be NO page reload.  If the user goes from .../vessles (index) to .../vessles/# () show then there will be NO page reload.  Is this an approved approach?

Vessel has_many Voyages via JSON is further detail on a vessel.  I plan to display this detail on the .../vessles (index) page "attached" to a particular vessel as an <ol>...</ol>.  Does this sound good?

Submitting the form.  This is the last thing I plan to do and I have not spent much time on it yet.  More to come there.  Please let me know what you think about the above.

Many thanks,
-- Chris
