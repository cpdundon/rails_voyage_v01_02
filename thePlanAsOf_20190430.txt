1. Get application.html.erb up and running properly (considering existing infrastructure)
2. Get page loads from page load/reload up and running - js for vessel index / vessel show.
3. Attach event handler to Click & <a>.  Use target url to determine if you need to e.preventDefault()
4. If e.perventDefault is necessary, paint the screen using js.  Otherwise let rails work its magic.
5. Architect the js form submit for vessel new.
